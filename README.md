local_mathslate
==============

Mathslate is a graphical tool for constructing mathematics within Moodle.
This plugin contains share code and resources for using it.  The are
some associated editor for TinyMCE and Atto editors plugins that require
this plugin.  Install this directory in the local directory with in the
moodle root directory named mathslate,and install each editor plugin in
the appropriate directory. Then visit the administrators notification
page to install the plugins to the database. For the Atto plugin you
will need to add mathslate to the list of toolbar buttons in the Atto
editor settings.

This plugin assumes MathJax is already included and configured in the
Moodle installation *without* the 'Safe' configuration option. The 'Safe'
option will interfere with some of the drag and drop functionality.
